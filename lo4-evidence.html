                                    <p>For the Cardan accessibility project, we created a UX research plan focused on user experience research for people with disabilities. Together with Noortje, I mainly focused on the UX research & interviews part of the project. The plan included research questions and methodologies, interview protocols and a simple user test. This showed our ability to apply research methods and include ethical considerations in the research process.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Initially, we weren't focusing on one specific disability yet, so I conducted additional research into cognitive disabilities to broaden our understanding. Later, we narrowed our focus to visual impairments. The research plan included different research methods: interviews with users with visual impairments, usability testing of existing interfaces, persona development based on real data, and user journey mapping to chart the complete user experience. This approach made sure that all findings were reliable and useful for the design process.</p>

                                    <p>The VTuber space has good opportunities but is very crowded with creators who lack consistent branding or strategic planning.

                                    <p>For team communication and coordination, I used Discord across all group projects. This platform made digital communication, meeting scheduling, and progress updates between team members work well. Through organized communication channels and regular check-ins, I made sure that all team members stayed engaged and that problems were quickly identified and solved.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The Discord implementation included different channels for different purposes: general project discussions, specific task-related communication, resource sharing, and social interaction to maintain team cohesion. This communication structure helped make all group projects successful.</p>

                                    <p>I kept documentation of teamwork experiences across three group projects: Boris Schmidt branding, Cardan UX project, and Project X. This documentation shows my collaboration skills and team dynamics management. By tracking how different teams worked, what challenges came up, and how they were solved, I learned valuable insights into good teamwork strategies.</p>
