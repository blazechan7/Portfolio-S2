                                    <h4>Career Day Experience</h4>
                                    <p>I dedicated significant time and attention to making informed decisions about my future academic path. I attended informative online sessions and participated in Career Day to gain insights into what would suit me best. Career Day was most valuable: I spoke with every company focusing on Media & Design. It was an educational day that gave me a clear picture of what to expect within the ICT & Media field.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Industry Insights</h4>
                                    <p>The branding agency resonated with me the most. I find conducting research and using various tools to create visual identity very interesting. This led me to consider that Open Learning might be a good fit for me, as I can determine my own learning objectives there. While I enjoy front-end development and love creating websites, I see it more as a hobby than something I want to build my career on.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Alumni Networking</h4>
                                    <p>During Career Day, I also asked various companies about their connection to Open Learning and whether they could tell me more about it. I spoke with alumni who shared their experiences from their time in Open Learning. I found their stories very inspiring and motivating.</p>

                                    <h4>First Portfolio Review</h4>
                                    <p>During the first portfolio review, I was allowed to participate online as an exception because I had conducted myself professionally in the branding project and was often present. I wanted to prevent it from being an exception again, so I made an effort to be present every day. Sometimes I was a bit late, but I always let my teachers know via Teams.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Second Portfolio Review & Improvement</h4>
                                    <p>During the second portfolio review, I still hadn't shown enough, particularly in the area of development challenges and projects. The Figma prototype was missing from my documentation. This was because we had divided tasks within the Create-That-UX project: Noortje and I focused mainly on research, interviews, and user journey.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>For the development project, Noortje and I incorporated Carolina's feedback and developed a new concept based on it, including a Figma prototype and website. I've now also included several user tests in my portfolio and added various projects, though it's not yet complete.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Third Portfolio Review - Progress Recognition</h4>
                                    <p>The third portfolio review went overall well, with no comments that I was missing any learning outcomes. However, I received several key points for improvement:</p>

                                            <li><strong>Portfolio Organization:</strong> My portfolio appeared disorganized because it wasn't yet complete, making it difficult for reviewers to navigate</li>
                                            <li><strong>Documentation Clarity:</strong> My documentation felt like a puzzle to piece together, lacking clear connections between projects and learning outcomes</li>
                                            <li><strong>Evidence Presentation:</strong> While I had completed the work, everything remained at beginner level assessment because I hadn't properly showcased the evidence in my portfolio structure</li>

                                    <p>This feedback made me realize the importance of not just completing quality work, but also presenting it in a clear, organized manner that demonstrates my growth and competency progression. I learned that the challenge isn't just doing the work, but translating completed projects into portfolio evidence that effectively communicates my learning achievements.</p>

                                    <h4>Project Selection Rationale</h4>
                                    <p>Why did I choose branding and content strategy for Project X? The Boris project appealed to me most because it involved creating a digital identity for an emerging artist. I found it an enjoyable and challenging assignment to discover his style and translate it visually and content-wise. My team members helped me well with this, making the process even more educational.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Future Learning Objectives</h4>
                                    <p>Branding and content strategy align well with my interests and skills. Since this will also be my main learning objective within Open Learning (if possible), I want to delve deeper into this area. I want to learn how to build strong, recognizable brands and how to create concrete and effective content plans for them. In the long term, I also want to help others develop their brand identity and online presence.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Research-Driven Approach</h4>
                                    <p>The research aspect of branding fits well with my personality. I'm eager to learn and want to understand why things work the way they do. Questions like "What do people find interesting on social media in 2025?" and "Which trends are effective?" motivate me to look beyond just the creative aspect. I also find it interesting how psychology plays a role in this, and how proven methods and tests contribute to successful strategies.</p>

                                    <p>I have demonstrated a self-directed learning approach through strategic career planning, networking activities, and reflective practice leading to focused specialization in branding and content strategy. Additionally, I actively attended Fontys events to gain better insight into my future career path, which helped me make more informed decisions about my academic and professional direction.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Throughout this journey, I remain committed to continuously improving myself and staying eager to learn and develop new things. This mindset of lifelong learning drives me to seek out new challenges and opportunities for growth, ensuring that I keep evolving both personally and professionally.</p>
